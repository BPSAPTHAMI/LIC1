### Theory :
Common source amplifier is a basic transistor amplifier circuit. It provides hoigh voltage gain with 180 phase shift. The input is at the gate or base, the output is from the drain or collector.It has high input impedance and moderate output impedance. It is used in audio, RF,and signal processing applications.
