A multivibrator is an electronic circuit that switches between two states (HIGH and LOW) to create different types of pulses or signals. It uses feedback to keep changing states.

The three types are:

1. Astable Multivibrator

No stable state â€” it continuously switches between HIGH and LOW, producing a continuous square wave.

It works like an oscillator generating clock pulses.



2. Monostable Multivibrator

One stable state and one temporary state.

When triggered, it switches to the temporary state for a fixed time, then returns to the stable state.

Used to create a single pulse of a specific duration.



3. Bistable Multivibrator

Two stable states.

It stays in one state until an external trigger switches it to the other state.

Acts like a flip-flop, used for storing binary data.
